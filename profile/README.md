# Skiddle Archives  
**Where ideas live on.**

Skiddle Archives is the archival branch of the Skiddle-ID organization.  
It serves as the long-term storage location for repositories that are **no longer maintained**, **no longer updated**, or **superseded**, but still valuable for reference, history, or reuse.

This allows the main Skiddle-ID organization to stay clean and organized, while still preserving older work that may be useful to developers, contributors, or future projects.

## 📂 Purpose

The goal of **Skiddle Archives** is to:

- Store inactive or legacy repositories  
- Preserve older projects without deleting them  
- Keep the main Skiddle-ID space focused on active development  
- Provide a historical record of past versions, experiments, and prototypes  
- Give developers a place to reference previous work at any time  

Repositories here are **not expected to receive updates or support**, but they remain publicly accessible for documentation, learning, or reuse.

## 🗂 What Belongs in Skiddle Archives?

A repository should be moved here if:

- It is **no longer actively maintained**  
- It has been **replaced** by a newer version or a different implementation  
- It was a **prototype, experiment, or early build**  
- It is kept **only for reference** and not for active development  
- It is deprecated but still useful as a code example, historical reference, or record  

Active or frequently updated projects should remain in the main Skiddle-ID organization.

## 🔧 Maintenance & Updates

Skiddle Archives is not a working development space.

- No bug fixes are required  
- No feature updates are expected  
- No new issues or PRs should be opened unless they relate to documentation or archival organization  

If a project is revived or reused in the future, it can be moved **back** to the main organization.
